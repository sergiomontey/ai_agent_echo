**Echo is proactive.** It quietly processes feedback as it arrives, immediately identifies critical issues, discovers hidden trends, and provides clear, actionable insights that drive real improvements to your product and customer experience.

*Echo doesn't just listen‚Äîit understands, analyzes, and guides your team toward better user experiences.*
