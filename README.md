## üèÜ Why Echo?

**Traditional feedback analysis is reactive.** Teams spend hours manually reading through feedback, trying to identify patterns, and struggling to prioritize what needs attention first.

**Echo is proactive.** It quietly processes feedback as it arrives, immediately identifies critical issues, discovers hidden trends, and provides clear, actionable insights that drive real improvements to your product and customer experience.

*Echo doesn't just listen‚Äîit understands, analyzes, and guides your team toward better user experiences.*
